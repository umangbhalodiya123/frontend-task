# frontend-task

### Prerequisites

I have used [mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com) to fetch the data, you will
need to add API key to run it locally.

Visit [mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com) and login to get the API key, and
visit `.env.example` file to see how to use it.

I have used [this schema from mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/502602f0)
(you will need to login to see the schema).

### Setup

Once you are done adding .env, install the dependencies, you can run below
command depending on the package manager you use:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm i
```

or

```
pnpm i
```

Then to start the project, you can run:

```
yarn dev
```

or

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
pnpm dev
```

---

Successfully doing all the above steps will run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
